<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>THIS IS NUMBERCRUNCH</h3>

<p>NumberCrunch is the newest fast-paced, block-stacking, brick-breaking game that is taking the world by storm. Your objective is to score as many points as you can by stacking blocks on top of each other. But be careful not to place a block in the wrong spot!</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RULES</h3>

<p>NumberCrunch is easy to learn, but takes a lifetime to master. The aim of the game is simple. Blocks will fall randomly from the top of the screen, and you must drag them onto 1 of 6 stacks. The thing is, only blocks that are of the same number or smaller can be placed on the top of a pile. For example, a 4 can go on a 4 or a 5, but not on a 3.</p>
<h3>
<a name="designer-templates-2" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SCORING</h3>

<p>To score points, finish a stack by placing a 1 on top. Every block that the 1 hits will be destroyed and its value will be added to your score. However, any block that is placed illegally will be subtracted from your score. So be careful where you place your blocks! </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
